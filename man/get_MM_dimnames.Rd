\description{
Internal function to read row and column names of a .mtx file
}
\details{
Can be used to read row and column names from .mtx files. Note: these files
must not contain a header (colnames).

The mtx_rowname_col_idx and mtx_colname_col_idx can be used to specify the column
index of the row and column name files, respectively. By default, the first
column is used for both.

TODO: Support for reading in only rownames or colnames.
